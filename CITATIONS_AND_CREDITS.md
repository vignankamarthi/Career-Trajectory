## Primary Architectural Influences

### 1. **Multi-Agent Systems and Confidence Thresholds**

**95% Confidence Architecture** - Our core innovation builds upon:

- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**: Tampuu et al. (2017) "Multiagent deep reinforcement learning with extremely sparse rewards"
- **Confidence-Based Agent Coordination**: Stone et al. (2000) "Multiagent Systems: A Survey from a Machine Learning Perspective"

**Implementation**: Our 4-agent pipeline with mandatory 95% confidence thresholds before expensive operations.

### 2. **Distributed Systems Patterns**

**Research Integration** - Inspired by distributed systems patterns:

- **Actor Model Pattern**: Hewitt et al. (1973) "A Universal Modular ACTOR Formalism for Artificial Intelligence"
- **Microservices Architecture**: Lewis & Fowler (2014) "Microservices" (martinfowler.com)
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Hohpe & Woolf (2003) "Enterprise Integration Patterns"

**Our Implementation**: Parallel AI research sub-agents integrated with 4-agent pipeline for timeline enrichment.

- Layer scaling (100% → 90% → 80%)
- Visual hierarchy through progressive disclosure
- Responsive design principles

### 3. **Parallel AI Research Integration**

**Implementation**: 5 specialized research sub-agents powered by Parallel AI API:
1. UniversityResearchAgent - University program analysis
2. CareerPathResearchAgent - Industry pathway research
3. SkillsGapAnalysisAgent - Skill requirement mapping
4. TimelineOptimizationAgent - Timeline efficiency analysis
5. QuickResearchAgent - Fast fact-checking (auto-approved)

**Integration Pattern**: Research sub-agents augment the 4-agent pipeline without blocking timeline generation.
