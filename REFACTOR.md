# REFACTOR PLAN - Recovery to NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE

##  **CURRENT POINTER**: Phase 2 COMPLETE - Ready for User Testing & Deployment!

---

## Problem Statement
- Had an AMAZING working project that was perfectly built around `NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- The final app UI was perfect and everything worked
- Accidentally reverted to an old version (without git)
- **GOAL**: Get back to that working state

## Target State
- Rebuild entire project to match specifications in `NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Restore the perfect UI that was working
- Ensure all functionality matches the final working version

## Current State
- Reverted to old version
- Need to rebuild according to NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md

---

## KEY ARCHITECTURE INSIGHTS (From File Analysis)

### NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md Core Features:
1. **Async Research Orchestrator** - Uses Parallel Task MCP Server for background research
2. **Chain of Agents Pattern** - Training-free, task-agnostic framework (2025 papers)
3. **MAPLE Memory System** - Multi-Agent Adaptive Planning for long-term memory
4. **Bayesian Nash Equilibrium Coordination** - Agent negotiation for optimal config
5. **Decoupled Research Latency** - Research doesn't block conversation flow
6. **Progressive Enhancement** - Timeline starts simple, gets richer over time
7. **WebSocket Real-Time Updates** - Live research progress notifications
8. **Per-Block Research Control** - User chooses research depth per block

### OLD vs NEW Architecture Comparison:

| Feature | OLD (AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) | NEW (NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md) |
|---------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Research Flow | Synchronous, blocks UI | Async, background tasks |
| User Experience | Wait 30-60s | See results in 5-10s |
| Research Control | All or nothing | Per-block granular control |
| Notifications | None | WebSocket real-time updates |
| Iteration Speed | Serial | Parallel (3-5x faster) |
| Memory System | None | MAPLE (planned v2.0) |

## REFACTOR EXECUTION TIMELINE

### **PHASE 0: Problem Definition**  COMPLETE
-  Goal: Restore NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md implementation
-  Scope: End-to-end system (frontend + backend + architecture)
-  Success Criteria: Async research, real-time updates, perfect UI

### **PHASE 1: Architecture Exploration**  COMPLETE

**Current Task**: Creating updated CLAUDE.md that reflects NEXT_GEN migration

#### Step 1.1: Read All Architecture Files  COMPLETE
-  Read AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md (old 4-agent system)
-  Read NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md (async + Chain of Agents)
-  Read CITATIONS_AND_CREDITS.md (academic attribution)
-  Read CLAUDE.md (current system config)

#### Step 1.2: Update CLAUDE.md  COMPLETE
-  Edit CLAUDE.md to reflect NEXT_GEN migration
-  Keep useful metadata (Parallel AI config, LangSmith, etc.)
-  State that we're following this refactoring plan
-  Maintain holistic role as global config file

#### Step 1.3: Create Holistic CLAUDE.md with Template  COMPLETE
-  Combine updated CLAUDE.md + Universal Technical Iteration Loop template
-  Integrate old information INTO template structure
-  **USER APPROVED** - Moving forward

#### Step 1.4: Update CITATIONS_AND_CREDITS.md  COMPLETE
-  Review what features are ACTUALLY implemented vs planned
-  Removed ALL citations for unimplemented features (Chain of Agents, MAPLE, MIRIX, SWEET-RL, STeCa, CS-Agent, CoMet)
-  Kept only foundational influences and framework credits
-  Added "Currently Implemented Features" section for clarity

#### Step 1.5: Rename Architecture Files  COMPLETE
-  Deleted AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md (old 4-agent synchronous system)
-  Renamed NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md → CURRENT_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md (new async target)

### **PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION**  COMPLETE

**Status**: ALL async research infrastructure + Chain of Agents + Frontend UI COMPLETE!

#### Backend Refactor  COMPLETE
-  Async Research Infrastructure
  -  ParallelMCPService implementation (background research tasks)
  -  Task queue system (in-memory with cleanup)
  -  WebSocket server setup (ws://localhost:3001/ws)
  -  Database schema updates for task tracking (research_tasks table + migration)
-  Chain of Agents Pattern
  -  ChainCoordinator implementation (agent orchestration)
  -  Agent async task spawning (background tasks)
  -  Background research execution (via ParallelMCP)
-  API Updates
  -  WebSocket endpoints for research updates (notifyResearchStarted/Complete/Error)
  -  Task status endpoints (checkTaskStatus, getTasksForBlock)
  -  Updated agent orchestration flow
  -  Test endpoint at /api/test/websocket for manual validation

#### Backend Validation Checkpoint  COMPLETE
**Critical Infrastructure Testing Before Frontend Development**

**Testing Results**:  ALL 8 TESTS PASSED!
-  Server initialization verified
-  WebSocket connection successful
-  Test research task created
-  research_started broadcast received
-  Background execution confirmed
-  research_complete broadcast received
-  Task status tracking operational
-  Error handling graceful (401 caught and handled)

**Backend Infrastructure**: 100% VALIDATED AND READY

---

#### Frontend Refactor  COMPLETE
-  Real-Time Notifications
  -  WebSocket client integration (useWebSocket hook with auto-connect/reconnect)
  -  ResearchNotification component (toast notifications with auto-dismiss)
  -  Pulsing blue dots for blocks being researched (animate-pulse-dot)
  -  Green glow + borders for research-complete blocks (animate-glow-green)
-  Progressive Enhancement UI
  -  Timeline displays immediately (no research blocking)
  -  Research happens in background (ParallelMCPService)
  -  Smooth transitions on research complete (Tailwind animations)
-  Navigation Enhancements
  -  Pricing button added (furthest right, always visible)
  -  Home button (conditional, appears when in timeline view)
  -  Theme toggle (dark mode support)

### **PHASE 3: Testing Strategy**  IN PROGRESS
-  Manual backend validation (8/8 tests passed)
-  WebSocket connection verification
-  Research task flow testing
-  User acceptance testing (full UI flow)
  - USER ACTION: Test at http://localhost:3000
  - Verify: Blue pulsing dots, green glow, toast notifications
  - Test: Create timeline, watch research indicators

### **PHASE 4: Documentation**  COMPLETE
-  CURRENT_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md - Fully updated with implementation details
-  PROJECT_SUMMARY.md - Updated to v2.0 with async features
-  README.md - Added v2.0 async architecture highlights

### **PHASE 5: Deployment**  PENDING
- [ ] User acceptance testing approval
- [ ] Git commit ALL Phase 2 changes
- [ ] Git push to remote
- [ ] Production deployment (if applicable)

## GIT WORKFLOW

Throughout development, group commits logically:
- Feature-based commits (e.g., "Add async research infrastructure")
- Test commits after major features
- Documentation commits after completion
- Follow good development practices

---

## NOTES & DISCOVERIES

### Key Insight #1: Research Latency Decoupling
The biggest change in NEXT_GEN is that research no longer blocks the UI. Users see timelines immediately and research enhances them progressively.

### Key Insight #2: WebSocket Architecture
Real-time updates require WebSocket server + client integration. This is a major infrastructure change.

### Key Insight #3: Chain of Agents Pattern
From 2025 NeurIPS paper (Zhang et al.). Training-free, task-agnostic multi-agent collaboration pattern.
