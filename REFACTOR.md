# REFACTOR PLAN - Recovery to NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE

## üéØ **CURRENT POINTER**: Phase 1 COMPLETE - Ready for Phase 2 Implementation (awaiting user check-in)

---

## Problem Statement
- Had an AMAZING working project that was perfectly built around `NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- The final app UI was perfect and everything worked
- Accidentally reverted to an old version (without git)
- **GOAL**: Get back to that working state

## Target State
- Rebuild entire project to match specifications in `NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Restore the perfect UI that was working
- Ensure all functionality matches the final working version

## Current State
- Reverted to old version
- Need to rebuild according to NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md

---

## KEY ARCHITECTURE INSIGHTS (From File Analysis)

### NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md Core Features:
1. **Async Research Orchestrator** - Uses Parallel Task MCP Server for background research
2. **Chain of Agents Pattern** - Training-free, task-agnostic framework (2025 papers)
3. **MAPLE Memory System** - Multi-Agent Adaptive Planning for long-term memory
4. **Bayesian Nash Equilibrium Coordination** - Agent negotiation for optimal config
5. **Decoupled Research Latency** - Research doesn't block conversation flow
6. **Progressive Enhancement** - Timeline starts simple, gets richer over time
7. **WebSocket Real-Time Updates** - Live research progress notifications
8. **Per-Block Research Control** - User chooses research depth per block

### OLD vs NEW Architecture Comparison:

| Feature | OLD (AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) | NEW (NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md) |
|---------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Research Flow | Synchronous, blocks UI | Async, background tasks |
| User Experience | Wait 30-60s | See results in 5-10s |
| Research Control | All or nothing | Per-block granular control |
| Notifications | None | WebSocket real-time updates |
| Iteration Speed | Serial | Parallel (3-5x faster) |
| Memory System | None | MAPLE (planned v2.0) |

## REFACTOR EXECUTION TIMELINE

### **PHASE 0: Problem Definition** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Goal: Restore NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md implementation
- ‚úÖ Scope: End-to-end system (frontend + backend + architecture)
- ‚úÖ Success Criteria: Async research, real-time updates, perfect UI

### **PHASE 1: Architecture Exploration** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Current Task**: Creating updated CLAUDE.md that reflects NEXT_GEN migration

#### Step 1.1: Read All Architecture Files ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Read AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md (old 4-agent system)
- ‚úÖ Read NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md (async + Chain of Agents)
- ‚úÖ Read CITATIONS_AND_CREDITS.md (academic attribution)
- ‚úÖ Read CLAUDE.md (current system config)

#### Step 1.2: Update CLAUDE.md ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Edit CLAUDE.md to reflect NEXT_GEN migration
- ‚úÖ Keep useful metadata (Parallel AI config, LangSmith, etc.)
- ‚úÖ State that we're following this refactoring plan
- ‚úÖ Maintain holistic role as global config file

#### Step 1.3: Create Holistic CLAUDE.md with Template ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Combine updated CLAUDE.md + Universal Technical Iteration Loop template
- ‚úÖ Integrate old information INTO template structure
- ‚úÖ **USER APPROVED** - Moving forward

#### Step 1.4: Update CITATIONS_AND_CREDITS.md ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Review what features are ACTUALLY implemented vs planned
- ‚úÖ Removed ALL citations for unimplemented features (Chain of Agents, MAPLE, MIRIX, SWEET-RL, STeCa, CS-Agent, CoMet)
- ‚úÖ Kept only foundational influences and framework credits
- ‚úÖ Added "Currently Implemented Features" section for clarity

#### Step 1.5: Rename Architecture Files ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Deleted AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md (old 4-agent synchronous system)
- ‚úÖ Renamed NEXT_GEN_ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Üí CURRENT_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md (new async target)

### **PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION** ‚è≥ PENDING

#### Backend Refactor (Detailed steps TBD after Phase 1 approval)
- [ ] Async Research Infrastructure
  - [ ] ParallelMCPService implementation
  - [ ] Task queue system (Redis/BullMQ)
  - [ ] WebSocket server setup
  - [ ] Database schema updates for task tracking
- [ ] Chain of Agents Pattern
  - [ ] ChainCoordinator implementation
  - [ ] Agent async task spawning
  - [ ] Background research execution
- [ ] API Updates
  - [ ] WebSocket endpoints for research updates
  - [ ] Task status endpoints
  - [ ] Updated agent orchestration flow

#### Frontend Refactor (Detailed steps TBD after Phase 1 approval)
- [ ] Real-Time Notifications
  - [ ] WebSocket client integration
  - [ ] ResearchNotification component
  - [ ] Pulsing dots for blocks being researched
  - [ ] Green borders for research-complete blocks
- [ ] Progressive Enhancement UI
  - [ ] Timeline displays immediately (no research)
  - [ ] Research happens in background
  - [ ] Smooth transitions on research complete
- [ ] Per-Block Research Control
  - [ ] Research processor choice UI
  - [ ] Cost transparency per block
  - [ ] "Refactor without research" button

### **PHASE 3: Testing Strategy** ‚è≥ PENDING
- Will brainstorm together after Phase 2 check-in
- Must include: career trajectory map testing
- Focus: Async flow, WebSocket updates, UI responsiveness

### **PHASE 4: Last-Minute UI Changes** ‚è≥ PENDING
- User plays with test career trajectory maps
- Make final UI adjustments based on feedback

### **PHASE 5: Documentation Finalization** ‚è≥ PENDING
- Sit down together and decide:
  - What to update
  - What to keep
  - What to delete
  - What to add
- Final state of project complete after documentation

## GIT WORKFLOW

Throughout development, group commits logically:
- Feature-based commits (e.g., "Add async research infrastructure")
- Test commits after major features
- Documentation commits after completion
- Follow good development practices

## NOTES & DISCOVERIES

### Key Insight #1: Research Latency Decoupling
The biggest change in NEXT_GEN is that research no longer blocks the UI. Users see timelines immediately and research enhances them progressively.

### Key Insight #2: WebSocket Architecture
Real-time updates require WebSocket server + client integration. This is a major infrastructure change.

### Key Insight #3: Chain of Agents Pattern
From 2025 NeurIPS paper (Zhang et al.). Training-free, task-agnostic multi-agent collaboration pattern.
