## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### Frontend (Vite + React 18 + TypeScript)
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms initial load time
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with full dark mode
- **State Management**: React Query with optimistic updates
- **Font System**: JetBrains Mono for consistent typography
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with pyramid timeline visualization

#### Backend (Express.js + TypeScript)
- **Database**: SQLite with optimized schema
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Research API**: Parallel AI with 9 tiers (lite to ultra8x)
- **Observability**: LangSmith tracing for full visibility
- **Security**: Input validation, sanitization, rate limiting

### Revolutionary Features

#### 1. Async Research Architecture
- Background research runs while users continue editing
- WebSocket real-time progress notifications
- Parallel Task MCP integration for non-blocking operations
- Progressive enhancement as research completes

#### 2. 95% Confidence Threshold
- Every agent must achieve 95% confidence before proceeding
- Conservative assumption policy prevents hallucination
- Multi-phase validation ensures quality

#### 3. Pyramid Timeline Visualization
- Layer 1: Strategic overview (4-10 year blocks)
- Layer 2: Tactical planning (0-5 year blocks)
- Layer 3: Execution details (0-1 year blocks)
- Visual cascade effect with 10% scale reduction per layer
